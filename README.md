# Nginx-Lua-Anti-DDoS
A Anti-DDoS script to protect Nginx web servers using Lua with a Javascript based authentication puzzle inspired by Cloudflare I am under attack mode I built my own Anti-DDoS authentication HTML page puzzle intergrating Lua, Javascript, HTML and HTTP knowledge.

Mitigate a DDoS attack of any size using DDoS my free protection. Don't get ddos attacked!

If you're under attack and use my script during the attack, visitors will receive an interstitial page for about five seconds while I analyze the traffic to make sure it is a legitimate human visitor.

# Requirements :
NONE! :D You only need Nginx + Lua to use my scripts.

###### Where can you download Nginx + Lua ?

Openresty provide Nginx + Lua builds for Windows Linux etc here.

https://openresty.org/en/download.html

Nginx4windows has Windows specific builds with Lua here.

Or you can download the source code for Nginx here and compile Nginx yourself with Lua.

# About :

I was inspired to create this because of Cloudflare feature "I'm Under Attack Mode" https://www.cloudflare.com/

There are similar sites and services like BitMitigate but I prefer my own script over their methods.

If you're under attack and have this feature enabled during the attack, visitors will receive an interstitial page for about five seconds while we analyze the traffic to make sure it is a legitimate human visitor.

Advanced DDoS Attack Protection

Unmetered DDoS mitigation to maintain performance and availability

Denial of Service attacks continue to grow in sophistication and force: more distributed, greater volumes of traffic, and encroaching on the application layer.

A successful attack increases unnecessary costs on your infrastructure and IT/security staff. More importantly, it hurts your revenue, customer satisfaction, and brand.

To combat attacks and stay online, you’ll need a solution that’s resilient scalable, and intelligent.

Mitigate a DDoS attack of any size or duration, Don't get ddos attacked!

I love that feature so much ontop of having it enabled on all my Cloudflare proxied sites I decided to make it into a feature on my own servers so the traffic that hits my servers without coming from Cloudflares network is kept in check and authenticated! (Every little helps right!)

Thank you to @Cloudflare for the inspiration and your community for all the love, A big thanks to the @openresty community you guys rock Lua rocks you are all so awesome!

Lets build a better internet together! Where Speed, Privacy, Security and Compression matter!
